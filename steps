#Adding insecure registries
If you want to connect to a private docker registry that is either

not configured for https
or configured for https using self-signed certificates
then add these configuration to /etc/docker/daemon.json
#
# ssh to worker node vi /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
  "insecure-registries": ["<ip>:<port>"]
}
And restart docker service

sudo systemctl daemon restart
